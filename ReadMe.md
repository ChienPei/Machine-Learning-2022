## Assignment HW1

_Description of HW1..._

In this initial assignment, we covered the basics of Python programming for data analysis. This included data manipulation with Pandas, visualization with Matplotlib, and introductory statistics.

- Topics: Python Basics, Pandas, Data Visualization
- Data: Included in the `HW1` folder

## Assignment HW2

_Description of HW2..._

The second assignment dived deeper into data preprocessing and began exploring machine learning models with Scikit-Learn. We focused on data cleaning, feature engineering, and building simple regression models.

- Topics: Data Preprocessing, Scikit-Learn, Regression Models
- Data: Included in the `HW2` folder

## Assignment HW3

_Description of HW3..._

For HW3, we tackled classification problems. The assignment walked us through the entire machine learning pipeline, from data preparation to training and evaluating classifiers like Decision Trees and SVMs.

- Topics: Classification, Decision Trees, SVM
- Data: Included in the `HW3` folder

## Assignment HW4

_Description of HW4..._

In this assignment, we explored ensemble methods and their efficacy in improving predictive performance. We experimented with Random Forests and Gradient Boosting machines, comparing their results to previous models.

- Topics: Ensemble Methods, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- Data: Included in the `HW4` folder

## Assignment HW5

_Description of HW5..._

HW5 focused on neural networks and deep learning using TensorFlow and Keras. We built and trained different architectures for image recognition tasks and discussed the theory behind deep learning techniques.

- Topics: Neural Networks, TensorFlow, Keras
- Data: Included in the `HW5` folder
